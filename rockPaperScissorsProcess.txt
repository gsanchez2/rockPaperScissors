OBJECTIVE
This program will allow users to play rock paper scissors against the computer
-we will create code that checks who won each round
-we willl create code that takes imput(choice) from the user
-we will create code that takes 'imput'(random funcion) from the computer
-we will create code that checks if the user wants to quit, or if the user doesnt enter one of the right options 
-we will loop each round of the game
-we will add statements at the end and the beginning that will wleocome and thank the user for playing
-we will loop the whole game, so that the user can keep playing until they choose to quit
